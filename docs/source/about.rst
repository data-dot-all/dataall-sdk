What is data.all SDK?
============================

An initiative that extends the power of the `data.all <https://github.com/data-dot-all/dataall>`_ open source project to be accessible programmatically via a Software Development Kit (SDK).

Data.all is an open source development framework to help you build a data marketplace on AWS.  Data.all builds a modern data workspace that makes collaboration among diverse users (like business, analysts and engineers) easier, increasing efficiency and agility in data projects âœ¨

To learn more about data.all, checkout out the `open source project on GitHub <https://github.com/data-dot-all/dataall>`_ or `documentation pages <https://data-dot-all.github.io/dataall/>`_

The data.all SDK is built with data.all in mind, aiming to provide data.all users with a seamless and efficient means of interfacing with data.all programmatically.
